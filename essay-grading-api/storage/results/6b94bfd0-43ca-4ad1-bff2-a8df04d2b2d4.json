  "original_text": "Democracy is a form of government that allows citizens to participate in the decision-making process through voting and representation. In a democratic system, the power ultimately rests with the people, who elect their leaders and representatives. This form of governance promotes equality, freedom of expression, and the protection of individual rights. Democracy encourages political participation and civic engagement, fostering a sense of responsibility among citizens. However, democracy also faces challenges such as voter apathy, political polarization, and the influence of money in politics. Despite these challenges, democracy remains one of the most effective ways to ensure government accountability and protect human rights. The success of democracy depends on an informed and engaged citizenry, strong institutions, and the rule of law. Through democratic processes, societies can address conflicts peacefully and work towards the common good.",
