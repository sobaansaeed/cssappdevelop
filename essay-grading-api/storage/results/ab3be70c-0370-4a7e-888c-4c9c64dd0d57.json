  "original_text": "Democracy is a form of government that allows citizens to participate in the decision-making process through voting and representation. In a democratic system, the power ultimately rests with the people, who elect their leaders and representatives. This form of governance promotes equality, freedom of expression, and the protection of individual rights. However, democracy also faces significant challenges in the modern world. Voter apathy, political polarization, and the influence of money in politics are major concerns that threaten the integrity of democratic processes.",
