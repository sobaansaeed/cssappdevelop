      "Thesis & Topic Understanding": {
        "score": 7,
        "feedback": "The thesis is present but lacks the necessary depth and precision for a CSS-level essay.  The chosen topic is broad, and the essay does not immediately narrow it down to a manageable scope."
      },
      "Outline Quality": {
        "score": 5,
        "feedback": "The outline, if present, is rudimentary and lacks the detailed structure and argumentative planning expected of a CSS-level essay.  It appears more as a list of points than a comprehensive roadmap for the essay."
      },
      "Structure & Coherence": {
        "score": 8,
        "feedback": "The essay shows some basic structural coherence, but the transitions between paragraphs are often abrupt and lack sophistication.  The overall flow is uneven."

      "Content Depth, Balance & Relevance": {
        "score": 8,
        "feedback": "The content demonstrates a general understanding of the topic, but the depth of analysis is insufficient for a CSS essay.  Supporting evidence and examples are weak and lack the rigorous citation expected at this level."

      "Language Proficiency & Expression": {
        "score": 4,
        "feedback": "The language used is acceptable, but there are frequent instances of awkward phrasing and grammatical errors.  The vocabulary is adequate but lacks the precision and sophistication expected at this level."
      },
      "Critical Thinking & Analytical Reasoning": {
        "score": 1,
        "feedback": "The essay shows limited critical thinking and analytical reasoning.  Arguments are presented but lack sufficient substantiation and counter-argument considerations."
      },
      "Conclusion": {
        "score": 2,
        "feedback": "The conclusion is weak and does not effectively summarize the main points or offer insightful closing remarks.  It feels rushed and lacks the impact a comprehensive conclusion should have."

        "score": 0,

    "summary_feedback": "This essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the chosen topic but fails to meet the standards expected of a CSS-level submission. The essay lacks depth of analysis, critical engagement, and the rigorous language proficiency and structural coherence required for a passing grade.
