Despite playing a  crucial role in maintaining urban hygiene, sanitation workers — mostly from   minority  communities — continue to suffer degrading treatment, hazardous working conditions, and  systemic exclusion. A recent report by Amnesty International, in collaboration with the  Centre for Law & Justice, underscores how these individuals are denied ba sic rights: they  are often hired through discriminatory advertisements requiring non - Muslim applicants,  lack formal job contracts, are paid less than minimum wage, and are forced to clean sewers  without protective gear. Social marginalisation adds to their   suffering, with many workers  subjected to verbal abuse, segregation, and even blasphemy allegations, such as those that  triggered the 2023 Jaranwala violence. The piece stresses the urgent need for structural  reforms, calling on the state to outlaw caste   discrimination, ensure fair hiring practices,  enforce labour protections, and replace manual sewer cleaning with machinery. Until  sanitation workers are treated with dignity and respect, Pakistan will continue to be  complicit in the ongoing exploitation an d silent violence against this essential, yet  oppressed, segment of its population.  Summary of   “ Arbaeen travel ban ”  The government’s recent decision to ban land travel to Iraq via Iran for the religious  pilgrimage of Arbaeen has sparked widespread criticism for being both abrupt and  seemingly unjustified, especially as it was announced just two weeks before the event.  I nterior Minister Mohsin Naqvi cited \"public safety and national security\" as the reasons  behind the move but did not provide specific details. Interestingly, neither Iran nor Iraq  appears to have objections to the overland travel of Pakistani pilgrims, and   the Iranian  embassy had even confirmed logistical support for the pilgrimage. Furthermore, no prior  indication of a ban was given during a recent trilateral meeting of interior ministers in  Tehran. The ban has left many pilgrims stranded in Quetta and cau sed significant financial  losses to tour operators who had already arranged visas, transport, and lodging. Critics  argue that while Balochistan does face serious security challenges, it is the state’s duty to  ensure safe passage rather than impose blanket   bans. Additionally, concerns about illegal  immigration through this route could be mitigated by holding tour operators accountable  for pilgrims’ return. The suggestion that all pilgrims should travel by air is seen as  impractical due to the high costs invo lved. Given these factors, the article strongly urges the\nGet Daily Vocabulary, Current Affairs, Dawn Editorial And Opinion With Urdu  Translation, Dawn Newspaper, Magazine WhatsApp 03410280618  Thursday  31 July  03410280618  government to lift the land travel ban and fulfill its responsibility to facilitate religious  freedoms and safe travel for its citizens.  Summary of “Sugar Politics”  The article highlights the alarming findings of the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP),  revealing that sugar mill owners have made an additional Rs300 billion in profits by sharply  increasing retail prices after being allowed to export sugar. This act, seen   as a result of the  industry's deep political influence, reflects a broader governance failure where the state  fails to regulate markets and protect consumers. The AGP’s testimony before the Public  Accounts Committee (PAC) suggests that powerful business l obbies, often overlapping with  the political elite, manipulate policy for their own gain. A major concern is the lack of  transparency in the ownership of sugar mills, many of which are indirectly controlled by top  government officials or their associates,   sometimes through proxies. The PAC suspects that  the export - import cycle of sugar   —   exporting at low prices and later importing at higher  rates   —   is a deliberate tactic to benefit a small group of politically connected families. The  committee has rightly d emanded full disclosure of the real owners of these mills. While this  call for transparency is commendable, past efforts   —   such as the 2020 inquiry during Imran  Khan's tenure and actions by the Competition Commission   —   have failed to curb the sugar  industr y's manipulative practices due to its entrenched political ties. Consequently, the  prospects for real reform remain dim, as the industry's influence over policymaking appears  too deeply rooted to challenge effectively.  Summary of “A Hybrid Wasteland” by Khurram Husain  The article paints a grim picture of Pakistan’s current political and democratic landscape  under a so - called hybrid regime   —   a system dominated by   bureaucrats and the  establishment, with political parties reduced to ceremonial roles. In such an environment,  no meaningful reform is possible, as the parties, despite being the traditional vessels of  public aspiration, are now more disorganized than ever . The ruling PML - N, with its long  history of comebacks, is struggling because its past economic model, based on debt - fueled  development and populist spending, is no longer viable. This leaves them clinging to power  in Punjab, which is only sustainable as l ong as their chief rival, Imran Khan, remains  imprisoned. The PPP, once the symbol of democratic resistance and transition from  dictatorship, has lost its ideological ground and now appears more interested in retaining a  share of power within the hybrid st ructure than in championing democracy. Ironically, the  PTI, once complicit in creating the hybrid setup, has now become the loudest voice of  public sentiment   —   albeit fractured from within, with its leadership divided, its supporters  confused, and its foun der imprisoned. Despite strong public backing, the PTI lacks a\nGet Daily Vocabulary, Current Affairs, Dawn Editorial And Opinion With Urdu  Translation, Dawn Newspaper, Magazine WhatsApp 03410280618  Thursday  31 July  03410280618  coherent strategy or ideology beyond populism. The author argues that unlike past eras   —  marked by movements like the 1973 Constitution, the 1988 election demands, or the 2008  Charter of Democracy   —   today there is no unifying vision or political initiative   to revive  democratic rule. As a result, Pakistan remains trapped in a “hybrid wasteland” with no clear  path forward, as establishment - backed governance continues to overshadow civilian  political will.  Summary of “Götterdämmerung” by F.S. Aijazuddin  The article presents a grim and thought - provoking reflection on global militarization and  the looming threat of widespread conflict, particularly under the influence of former U.S.  President Donald Trump. The author argues that World War III effectively be gan after  World War II ended in 1945, with continuous conflicts in regions like Vietnam, Iraq, Syria,  Yemen, Gaza, and Ukraine. He criticizes Trump for escalating militaristic rhetoric and  pushing allies, especially in Europe and Japan, to significantly bo ost their defense spending  —   not for global security, but to serve America’s military - industrial complex. The article  notes that Trump’s proposal for each NATO country to spend 5% of GDP on defense would  massively benefit U.S. arms manufacturers, who alrea dy dominate European markets and  reap billions in profits. The historical warning of President Eisenhower about the dangers of  a powerful military - industrial complex is echoed, with modern evidence showing how  billions from U.S. defense budgets funnel into   private corporations. The author contrasts  Trump’s aggressive posturing with past leaders like Nixon, who saw China not as a threat  but a partner in peace. However, the landscape has changed: China is now positioning itself  as the next global superpower,   yet spends far less on military expansion than the U.S.  Aijazuddin warns that future wars will be fought in the skies and space, and unless current  trends are checked, we may be heading toward a catastrophic showdown   —   a modern - day  Götterdämmerung , or “twi light of the gods,” symbolizing total collapse.  Summary of “Trapped in the Past” by Hassan A. Shah  The article critiques the outdated governance model of public universities in Pakistan,  particularly in Punjab, and calls for urgent structural reform to align higher education with  21st - century needs. The author, drawing from over 40 years of experience i n the Punjab  education system, argues that these universities still operate under colonial - era systems  designed to produce obedient clerks rather than independent thinkers. Despite reforms like  the creation of the Higher Education Commission (HEC), the leg al and administrative  frameworks remain rigid and overly politicized. Key decisions in universities require  approval from multiple layers of government, including the governor, chief minister, and  various bureaucratic offices, leading to chronic delays and   administrative paralysis.\nGet Daily Vocabulary, Current Affairs, Dawn Editorial And Opinion With Urdu  Translation, Dawn Newspaper, Magazine WhatsApp 03410280618  Thursday  31 July  03410280618  Unlike universities worldwide that are adapting to new technologies and forming industry  partnerships, Pakistan’s institutions are stifled by red tape. Vice Chancellors lack the  autonomy to hire faculty or update academic programs, while key posts often re main  unfilled due to political or bureaucratic interference. There is little accountability or  performance - based planning, and the system still rewards conformity over creativity.  Although a few research centers in AI, biotechnology, and quantum computing   show  promise, they are exceptions in an otherwise stagnant system.  Shah recommends comprehensive reforms: shifting decision - making power to academic  bodies like syndicates and senates, appointing university leaders through transparent,  merit - based processes led by scholars, and replacing political oversight with independe nt  boards of trustees drawn from diverse sectors. Financial autonomy is also essential, with  universities needing the freedom to raise and manage funds, linked to performance metrics  like research output and graduate employability. Administrative functions   should be  digitized for efficiency and transparency. The author concludes that unless these changes  are made, Pakistan’s universities will continue to decline, jeopardizing the nation's ability to  train future thinkers and leaders. The transformation of h igher education, he stresses, is  not just an academic concern but a national necessity.  Summary of “Pakistan’s Changing Climate” by Ali Tauqeer Sheikh  The article provides a sobering analysis of how climate change is radically altering Pakistan’s  monsoon patterns and flood dynamics. The traditional,   predictable monsoon system is  breaking down, with rainfall now becoming more intense but less frequent, and shifting  geographically from northern to southern regions. This shift is straining outdated  infrastructure and challenging conventional flood manage ment policies. The rising  temperature   —   increasing at 0.18°C annually in the monsoon belt   —   is significantly  boosting the atmosphere’s capacity to hold moisture, which, when released during  monsoons, causes devastating downpours. A new pattern has emerged:   heatwaves precede  and intensify monsoon rains, creating a cycle of extreme weather that requires urgent,  integrated policy reform.  The article identifies five major trends reshaping Pakistan’s flood landscape:  1.   Non - riverine flooding   is increasingly common due to sudden, localized downpours  that overwhelm poorly maintained drainage systems, especially in cities like Karachi  and Chakwal.  2.   Cloudbursts , intense rainfall over small areas, have become more frequent,  particularly in the northern regions. These often trigger deadly flash floods and  landslides, yet are sometimes mislabelled, undermining effective risk planning.\nGet Daily Vocabulary, Current Affairs, Dawn Editorial And Opinion With Urdu  Translation, Dawn Newspaper, Magazine WhatsApp 03410280618  Thursday  31 July  03410280618  3.   Koh - i - Sulaiman   has emerged as a dangerous flood zone, where intense rainfall  causes torrents that devastate valleys in southern Punjab, offering both risk and  opportunity for water management solutions.  4.   The Salt Range and barani areas   are witnessing climate volatility, including extreme  rainfall, hailstorms, and erosion due to broken private dams and heatwave impacts.  5.   Urban flooding   has worsened due to unchecked development, ineffective drainage  systems, and the urban heat island effect, turning major cities into flood zones during  heavy rains.  The article warns that heatwaves are not just a precursor but a trigger for floods, as  hardened soil fails to absorb water, and saturated land exacerbates repeated rainfall.  Pakistan now faces a “double jeopardy”   —   non - riverine floods from local storms and  traditional riverine floods fed by upstream weather events in India. The author calls for a  complete overhaul of flood management systems, integrating climate data, empowering  local disaster authorities, deploying rapid - response units, and investing in na ture - based and  infrastructure solutions. In conclusion, climate - smart planning is no longer optional but a  national imperative for survival.",
