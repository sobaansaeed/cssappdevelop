    "overall_score": 38,
    "category_scores": {
      "Thesis & Topic Understanding": {
        "score": 7,
        "feedback": "The thesis is present and identifies the dual nature of technology's impact on education, but lacks nuance and originality."
      },
      "Outline Quality": {
        "score": 0,
        "feedback": "No discernible outline is present.  The essay lacks a structured approach, impacting overall coherence."
      },
      "Structure & Coherence": {
        "score": 8,
        "feedback": "The essay follows a basic structure (intro, body, conclusion), but transitions are weak and the flow is somewhat disjointed. Paragraphs lack development and depth."
      },
      "Content Depth, Balance & Relevance": {
        "score": 10,
        "feedback": "The content touches upon key aspects of the topic, including the digital divide and personalized learning. However, the analysis is superficial and lacks supporting evidence or examples.  Points are stated rather than argued."
      },
      "Language Proficiency & Expression": {
        "score": 7,
        "feedback": "The language is understandable but contains several grammatical errors and stylistic flaws (e.g., repetition, awkward phrasing). The writing style is simplistic and repetitive."
      },
      "Critical Thinking & Analytical Reasoning": {
        "score": 1,
        "feedback": "Critical analysis is minimal. The essay presents a somewhat balanced view, but lacks a sophisticated understanding of the complex interplay between technology and pedagogy."
      },
      "Conclusion": {
        "score": 5,
        "feedback": "The conclusion restates the introduction without offering significant new insights or recommendations.  It lacks impact and strength."
      },
      "Word Count & Length Control": {
        "score": 0,
        "feedback": "Essay is significantly below the required word count.  This severely limits the depth and sophistication of the analysis."
      }
    },
    "summary_feedback": "This essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the topic, but falls short of the standards expected at the CSS level. The analysis is superficial, lacking depth, supporting evidence, and critical engagement.  Grammatical errors and weak structure further detract from the essay's quality.  The significant shortfall in word count is a major deficiency.  Significant improvement in argumentation, critical analysis, and writing proficiency is required.",
