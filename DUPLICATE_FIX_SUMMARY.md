# Past Papers Duplicate Issue - FIXED ✅

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

The past papers upload system was creating duplicate entries in the database. Each past paper was being uploaded twice, resulting in:
- **Original count**: 112 past papers (with 54 duplicates)
- **Final count**: 58 unique past papers

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The `add-past-paper-from-folder.js` script was:
1. Scanning all folders for PDF files
2. Adding ALL found files to the database
3. **No duplicate checking** before adding entries
4. Running the script multiple times would create more duplicates

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Upload Script (`add-past-paper-from-folder.js`)**
- Added `pastPaperExists()` function to check for duplicates
- Checks based on: `subjectId`, `year`, and `paperNumber`
- Automatically skips existing entries with warning messages
- Prevents future duplicates from being created

### **2. Duplicate Cleanup Script (`remove-duplicate-past-papers.js`)**
- Created new script to remove existing duplicates
- Identifies duplicates based on unique key: `${subjectId}-${year}-${paperNumber}`
- Keeps the first occurrence of each unique past paper
- Provides detailed reporting of what was removed

## 📊 **Results**

### **Before Fix:**
- Total entries: 112
- Duplicates: 54
- Unique papers: 58

### **After Fix:**
- Total entries: 58 ✅
